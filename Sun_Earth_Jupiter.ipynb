    "\n",
    "The problem corresponds to determine the trajectories of three bodies in space under the influence of their mutual gravity forces (e.g., the motion of the Sun, Moon and Earth, taken together). Isaac Newton was the first person to try to solve this problem. In 1887, Bruns and Poincar√© showed that there is no general analytical closed solution for this problem. In fact, the motion of the three bodies is generally non-repeating! That's pretty amazing.\n",

    "## Universal Law of Gravitation\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton taught us that two bodies with masses $m_0$ and $m_1$ attract themselves with a force proportional to their masses and inversionally proportional to the square of their distance $d$. This is called the [Universal Law of Gravitation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_universal_gravitation). Mathematically this is expressed by: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F = G \\frac{m_0 \\, m_1}{d^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $G$ is the gravitational constant. But, if we want to consider the movement of three bodies in space, we'll need to formulate this in terms of vector calculus. Let's suppose that mass $m_0$ is at position $\\vec{r_0}$ and $m_1$ at position $\\vec{r_1}$. This is shown in the next diagram (which also shows a mass $m_2$ and its position -- for now, assume it doesn't exist):\n",
    "\n",
    "![System](https://thibaudetienne.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/tbp.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the law of gravitation can be formulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{F_{01}} = - G \\frac{m_0 m_1}{{\\vert \\vec{r_0} - \\vec{r_1} \\vert}^2} \\hat{r_{01}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\vec{F_{01}}$ is the force exerted on $m_1$ due to $m_0$ and $\\hat{r_{01}}$ is the unit vector from $m_0$ to $m_1$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{r_{01}} = \\frac{\\vec{r_1} - \\vec{r_0}}{\\vert \\vec{r_1} - \\vec{r_0} \\vert} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "By simple manipulation we can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{F_{01}} = - G \\, m_0 \\, m_1 \\frac{\\vec{r_1} - \\vec{r_0}}{{\\vert \\vec{r_1} - \\vec{r_0} \\vert}^3}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there's an important thing that we also know: force equals mass times accelaration (Newton's second law) and that accelaration is the second derivative of position:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{F} = m \\frac{d^2\\vec{r}}{dt^2} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "If we only had two bodies this would be great. But, with three bodies, we need to consider all the interactions and forces. Since we are calculating the accelaration of $m_1$ we just need to add the force corresponding to $\\vec{F_{21}}$:\n",

    "Now we need to define a function $\\dot{g} = f(t, g)$ where $g$ is a function of time $t$ and $\\dot{g}$ represents its derivative. Using the Sundials library this is done by defining a function ```f(t, g, gdot)```. The function should update the return parameter ```gdot``` with the derivative of ```g(t)``` at time ```t```. Note that this design is not particularly great -- it would be much better if we could just return ```gdot```. (Note that typically $\\dot{g} = f(t, g)$ is written as $\\dot{y} = f(t, y)$. We are not doing so because we'll be using $x$ and $y$ to denote coordinates.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the equations above it's easy to see that both ```y``` and ```ydot``` are going to be 12-entry vectors. We are going to work in two dimentions: X and Y. Thus, each vector $\\vec{r_k(t)}$ is going to correspond to two coordinates: $\\vec{r_k(t)} = (x_k(t), y_k(t))$. Since we have 3 of these position vectors this corresponds to 6 entries. Since the differencial equations above are of second order, we will need the derivatives of each one of $\\vec{r_k(t)}$, which corresponds to the bodies velocities $\\vec{v_k(t)}$. Since we have 3 bodies, each with an X and Y velocity, we get 6 other entries.\n",
